                   About Scanner
----------------------------------------------------

Scanner is an security tool to check vulnerabilities on network targets, it's thinking is from an opensource project named Openvas(http://openvas.org/).

This Scanner project is implemented with node.js, node.js is not the most efficient language to write some tools like this, but I choose it for the asynchronized IO, cause the scanner makes a lot of request via the network, so this the io operation is busy.

And if somebody want to join this project, feel free to mail to timonwst[A--T]gmail.com.
